# Kira Prolongation Support Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Simple and Direct
Write the simplest code that solves the problem. No abstractions, patterns, or "best practices" until you actually need them. If it works and you understand it, ship it.

### II. Test What Matters
Only write tests for things that will actually break or are hard to verify by running the app. Manual testing is fine. Don't chase coverage numbers - chase confidence.

### III. Done Over Perfect
Working code beats perfect code. Ship features when they work, not when they're polished. You can always improve it later if needed.

## Governance

This is a personal project. These principles are guidelines, not laws. Change them whenever they stop being helpful.

**Update this doc if:**
- You keep hitting the same problem
- A principle becomes annoying instead of helpful
- You learn something that changes your approach
