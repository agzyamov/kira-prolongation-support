# Kira Prolongation Support

Personal project for managing Kira prolongation support.

## Getting Started

This project uses [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) for spec-driven development.

### Available Commands

Use these commands in your AI assistant (Claude/Cursor):

- `/constitution` - View or update project principles
- `/specify` - Create a feature specification
- `/clarify` - Ask structured questions about unclear requirements (optional)
- `/plan` - Generate implementation plan from spec
- `/tasks` - Break down plan into actionable tasks
- `/implement` - Execute the implementation

### Workflow

1. **Specify**: Describe what you want to build
2. **Plan**: Generate technical implementation plan
3. **Tasks**: Break it down into specific tasks
4. **Implement**: Build it

### Project Principles

This is a personal project focused on:
- **Simple and Direct**: No overengineering, just what works
- **Test What Matters**: Only test critical paths
- **Done Over Perfect**: Ship working features, iterate later

See `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for details.

## Development

```bash
# Your development commands will go here as you build features
```
