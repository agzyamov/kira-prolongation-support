- [ ] Status messages are clear and helpful

### Scenario 4: Data Validation and Quality
**Objective**: Verify that fetched data is validated for quality and accuracy

**Steps**:
1. Fetch TÜFE data using the easy fetch feature
2. Verify that the system:
   - Validates data format and structure
   - Checks data reasonableness
   - Compares with historical data
   - Displays data quality score
   - Shows validation warnings if any

**Expected Result**: Data is validated and quality information is displayed

**Validation**:
- [ ] Data format is validated
- [ ] Data reasonableness is checked
- [ ] Quality score is displayed
- [ ] Validation warnings are shown if applicable

### Scenario 5: Error Handling and User Feedback
**Objective**: Verify that errors are handled gracefully with user-friendly messages

**Steps**:
1. Simulate network failure (disconnect internet)
2. Click "Get TÜFE Data" button
3. Verify that the system:
   - Attempts all available sources
   - Displays clear error messages
   - Offers fallback to manual entry
   - Provides helpful troubleshooting tips

**Expected Result**: Errors are handled gracefully with clear user feedback

**Validation**:
- [ ] All sources are attempted
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Manual entry fallback is offered
- [ ] Troubleshooting tips are provided

### Scenario 6: Performance and Caching
**Objective**: Verify that the system performs well and uses caching effectively

**Steps**:
1. Fetch TÜFE data for the first time
2. Note the fetch time and source used
3. Fetch the same data again immediately
4. Verify that the system:
   - Returns cached data quickly (< 100ms)
   - Shows cache hit indicator
   - Maintains source attribution
   - Respects cache expiration

**Expected Result**: Cached data is returned quickly with proper attribution

**Validation**:
- [ ] Cache hit is fast (< 100ms)
- [ ] Cache hit indicator is shown
- [ ] Source attribution is maintained
- [ ] Cache expiration is respected

### Scenario 7: Source Health Monitoring
**Objective**: Verify that source health is monitored and updated automatically

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the "TÜFE Data Sources" section
2. View the source health dashboard
3. Verify that the system displays:
   - Current health status of all sources
   - Reliability scores
   - Response times
   - Last health check timestamps
   - Success/failure rates

**Expected Result**: Source health information is displayed and updated automatically

**Validation**:
- [ ] Health status is displayed
- [ ] Reliability scores are shown
- [ ] Response times are tracked
- [ ] Health checks are automatic

### Scenario 8: Multi-Year Data Fetching
**Objective**: Verify that users can fetch TÜFE data for multiple years

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the "Inflation Data" page
2. Select multiple years (e.g., 2020, 2021, 2022)
3. Click "Get TÜFE Data" button
4. Verify that the system:
   - Fetches data for all selected years
   - Shows progress for each year
   - Handles partial failures gracefully
   - Displays results for all successful fetches

**Expected Result**: Data is fetched for multiple years with proper progress tracking

**Validation**:
- [ ] Multiple years are processed
- [ ] Progress is tracked for each year
- [ ] Partial failures are handled
- [ ] Results are displayed clearly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "No sources available"
- **Cause**: All TÜFE data sources are unavailable
- **Solution**: Check internet connection and try again
- **Fallback**: Use manual data entry

**Issue**: "Data validation failed"
- **Cause**: Fetched data doesn't meet quality standards
- **Solution**: System will try alternative sources automatically
- **Fallback**: Manual data entry with validation

**Issue**: "Slow response times"
- **Cause**: Network issues or source performance problems
- **Solution**: System will automatically try faster sources
- **Fallback**: Use cached data if available

### Performance Tips

1. **Use Caching**: The system automatically caches data for 24 hours
2. **Check Source Health**: Monitor source health dashboard for optimal performance
3. **Batch Requests**: Fetch multiple years in a single operation
4. **Offline Mode**: Use manual entry when network is unavailable

### Data Quality

- All data is validated before storage
- Source attribution is maintained for audit trails
- Quality scores help identify reliable data
- Historical validation ensures consistency
