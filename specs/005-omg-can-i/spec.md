# Feature Specification: Easy T√úFE Data Fetching

**Feature Branch**: `005-omg-can-i`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "omg can i fetch tufe in an easy way"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the rental negotiation support tool, I want to fetch T√úFE (Turkish inflation) data easily without dealing with complex API configurations, network issues, or manual data entry, so that I can quickly get the official inflation rates needed for my rental negotiations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I need T√úFE data for my rental calculations, **When** I click a simple "Get T√úFE Data" button, **Then** the system should automatically fetch the latest official T√úFE rates without requiring me to configure API keys or deal with technical setup
2. **Given** the TCMB API is blocked or unavailable, **When** I request T√úFE data, **Then** the system should automatically find and use alternative reliable sources for Turkish inflation data
3. **Given** I want to fetch T√úFE data for a specific year, **When** I select the year and click fetch, **Then** the system should retrieve the official T√úFE rate for that year from a reliable source
4. **Given** I need T√úFE data but don't want to deal with technical setup, **When** I use the easy fetch feature, **Then** the system should work with zero configuration required from me

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all T√úFE data sources are unavailable?
- How does the system handle network timeouts or connection issues?
- What if the user needs T√úFE data for future years that don't exist yet?
- How does the system handle data quality issues or inconsistent sources?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a one-click T√úFE data fetching capability that requires no user configuration
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically attempt multiple reliable T√úFE data sources when primary source fails
- **FR-003**: System MUST fetch T√úFE data for any year from 2000 to current year without user intervention
- **FR-004**: System MUST display clear status messages during data fetching process
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically cache fetched T√úFE data to avoid repeated API calls
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide fallback to manual entry when all automatic sources fail
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate fetched T√úFE data for reasonableness before storing
- **FR-008**: System MUST show data source attribution for all fetched T√úFE data
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle network errors gracefully with user-friendly error messages
- **FR-010**: System MUST support fetching T√úFE data for multiple years in a single operation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **T√úFE Data Source**: Represents different sources of Turkish inflation data, with reliability ratings and availability status
- **T√úFE Data Cache**: Stores fetched T√úFE data with source attribution, fetch timestamp, and expiration information
- **Data Fetching Session**: Tracks the status of T√úFE data fetching operations, including retry attempts and error handling
