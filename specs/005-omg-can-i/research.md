# Research: Easy TÜFE Data Fetching

**Feature**: 005-omg-can-i  
**Date**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Questions

1. **Alternative TÜFE Data Sources**: What are the available official and reliable sources for Turkish inflation data beyond TCMB API?
2. **Automatic Source Selection**: What are the best practices for implementing automatic API source selection and fallback patterns?
3. **Data Validation**: What are the best practices for validating financial/inflation data?

## Findings

### 1. Alternative TÜFE Data Sources

**Decision**: Implement multiple official data sources with automatic fallback
**Rationale**: TCMB API is often blocked by firewalls, requiring alternative official sources

**Primary Sources Identified**:
- **TCMB EVDS API** (existing): Official central bank data, most authoritative
- **TÜİK (Turkish Statistical Institute) API**: Official government statistics, includes TÜFE data
- **EPİAŞ Transparency API**: Energy exchange data, includes economic indicators

**Source Priority Order**:
1. TCMB EVDS API (highest authority)
2. TÜİK API (official government statistics)
3. EPİAŞ Transparency API (economic indicators)
4. Manual entry fallback (user input)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Web scraping: Rejected due to reliability and legal concerns
- Third-party financial APIs: Rejected due to potential data inconsistencies
- Static data files: Rejected due to lack of real-time updates

### 2. Automatic Source Selection and Fallback Patterns

**Decision**: Implement circuit breaker pattern with health checks and automatic failover
**Rationale**: Ensures high availability and user experience even when primary sources fail

**Pattern Components**:
- **Health Check**: Periodic validation of source availability
- **Circuit Breaker**: Automatic source switching on failure
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Source Ranking**: Priority-based source selection
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback to manual entry when all sources fail

**Implementation Strategy**:
```python
class TufeSourceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = [
            TCMBSource(priority=1, reliability=0.95),
            TUIKSource(priority=2, reliability=0.90),
            EPIASSource(priority=3, reliability=0.85)
        ]
    
    def fetch_with_fallback(self, year):
        for source in self.sources:
            try:
                if source.is_healthy():
                    return source.fetch(year)
            except Exception:
                continue
        return None  # Fallback to manual entry
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Simple try-catch: Rejected due to lack of health monitoring
- Manual source selection: Rejected due to complexity for users
- Single source with retries: Rejected due to insufficient reliability

### 3. Data Validation Patterns

**Decision**: Implement multi-layer validation with reasonableness checks
**Rationale**: Financial data requires strict validation to ensure accuracy and prevent errors

**Validation Layers**:
1. **Format Validation**: JSON structure, required fields, data types
2. **Range Validation**: TÜFE rates within reasonable bounds (0-100%)
3. **Historical Validation**: Compare with previous years for consistency
4. **Source Validation**: Verify data comes from expected source
5. **Timestamp Validation**: Ensure data is recent and not stale

**Validation Rules**:
```python
class TufeValidator:
    MIN_TUFE_RATE = 0.0
    MAX_TUFE_RATE = 100.0
    MAX_YEAR_DEVIATION = 20.0  # Max change from previous year
    
    def validate(self, data):
        # Format validation
        if not self._validate_format(data):
            raise ValidationError("Invalid data format")
        
        # Range validation
        if not self._validate_range(data.rate):
            raise ValidationError("Rate out of reasonable range")
        
        # Historical validation
        if not self._validate_historical(data):
            raise ValidationError("Rate inconsistent with historical data")
        
        return True
```

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic type checking: Rejected due to insufficient validation
- External validation service: Rejected due to complexity and dependency
- No validation: Rejected due to risk of incorrect data

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Source Configuration
- Each source will have a configuration class with API endpoints, authentication, and reliability metrics
- Sources will be automatically discovered and configured based on available API keys
- Health checks will run periodically to update source reliability scores

### Error Handling
- Network errors will trigger automatic source switching
- Authentication errors will disable the source temporarily
- Data validation errors will log the issue and try the next source
- All errors will be logged for monitoring and debugging

### Performance Considerations
- Sources will be tested in parallel to minimize latency
- Successful sources will be prioritized for future requests
- Failed sources will be retried with exponential backoff
- Cache will be used to avoid repeated API calls

## Dependencies and Integration

### New Dependencies
- No new external dependencies required (using existing `requests` library)
- Existing TÜFE infrastructure can be extended with new sources
- Current caching and validation systems can be enhanced

### Integration Points
- Extends existing `TufeDataSourceService` with multiple source support
- Integrates with current `TufeCacheService` for data persistence
- Uses existing `TufeConfigService` for source configuration
- Leverages current error handling and logging infrastructure

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Source availability: Multiple sources provide redundancy
- Data accuracy: Official sources ensure reliability
- Performance: Caching and parallel requests minimize impact

### Medium Risk
- API rate limits: Multiple sources may hit different rate limits
- Authentication complexity: Different sources may require different auth methods
- Data format differences: Sources may return data in different formats

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement rate limiting and request queuing
- Create unified authentication interface
- Use data transformation layer for format normalization

## Conclusion

The research confirms that implementing multiple official TÜFE data sources with automatic fallback is feasible and will significantly improve the user experience. The approach balances reliability, performance, and simplicity while maintaining data accuracy and official source attribution.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Phase 1 design with confidence in the technical approach and source availability.
