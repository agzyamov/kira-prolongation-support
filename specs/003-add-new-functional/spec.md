# Feature Specification: Add New Functional Requirements

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-new-functional`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add new functional requirements for the "Rental Fee Negotiation Support Tool":"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a tenant preparing for rent negotiations, I want the system to provide legally accurate rent increase calculations and neutral presentation options so that I can present my case professionally and effectively to my landlord.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a rental agreement with a start date before July 1, 2024, **When** I view the negotiation summary, **Then** the system displays "+25% (limit until July 2024)" as the legal maximum increase
2. **Given** a rental agreement with a start date after July 1, 2024, **When** I view the negotiation summary, **Then** the system displays "+CPI (Yearly T√úFE)" as the legal maximum increase
3. **Given** I select "Calm" negotiation mode, **When** I view the summary, **Then** the system hides growth arrows and uses subdued visual styling
4. **Given** I select "Assertive" negotiation mode, **When** I view the summary, **Then** the system highlights changes with bold numbers and prominent visual indicators
5. **Given** I have multiple rental agreements, **When** I view the TL vs USD chart, **Then** the system shows vertical markers labeled "New Agreement (YYYY)" at contract boundaries
6. **Given** I export a negotiation summary, **When** I view the exported document, **Then** it includes "Data source: TCMB (exchange rates), T√úFE (inflation)" for transparency

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the system cannot determine the applicable legal rule for a given period?
- How does the system handle missing T√úFE data for periods after July 2024?
- What happens when a user switches negotiation modes mid-session?
- How does the system handle overlapping rental agreements in visualizations?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically determine the applicable legal rule for rent increases based on agreement period (pre/post July 1, 2024)
- **FR-002**: System MUST display "+25% (limit until July 2024)" for agreements starting before July 1, 2024
- **FR-003**: System MUST display "+CPI (Yearly T√úFE)" for agreements starting after July 1, 2024
- **FR-004**: System MUST use neutral wording ("Aligned with market average") instead of emotionally charged terms in generated summaries
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a user-selectable negotiation mode setting with "Calm" and "Assertive" options
- **FR-006**: System MUST hide growth arrows and use subdued visuals when "Calm" mode is selected
- **FR-007**: System MUST highlight changes with bold numbers and prominent indicators when "Assertive" mode is selected
- **FR-008**: System MUST include vertical markers labeled "New Agreement (YYYY)" on TL vs USD charts to show contract boundaries
- **FR-009**: System MUST include "Data source: TCMB (exchange rates), T√úFE (inflation)" in every exported summary
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist the user's negotiation mode preference across sessions
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle cases where T√úFE data is unavailable for post-July 2024 periods by displaying "T√úFE data pending" and allowing manual entry of the official CPI rate
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that agreement dates are correctly interpreted for legal rule determination

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Legal Rule**: Represents the applicable rent increase regulation (25% cap vs CPI-based), includes effective date range and calculation method
- **Negotiation Mode**: User preference setting that controls visual presentation style (Calm/Assertive), affects summary generation and chart display
- **Agreement Boundary**: Visual marker on charts indicating contract start/end dates, includes year label for clarity
- **Data Source Attribution**: Required disclosure information for exported documents, includes specific source names and data types
