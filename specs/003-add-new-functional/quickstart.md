# Quickstart: Add New Functional Requirements

**Feature**: Add New Functional Requirements for Rental Fee Negotiation Support Tool  
**Date**: 2025-10-05  
**Branch**: 003-add-new-functional

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Legal CPI/Cap Context
**Given**: A rental agreement with payments spanning before and after July 1, 2024  
**When**: I view the negotiation summary  
**Then**: The "Legal max increase" must correctly display:
- "+25% (limit until July 2024)" for periods up to June 30, 2024
- "+CPI (Yearly T√úFE)" for periods after July 1, 2024

**Test Steps**:
1. Create rental agreement with start date before July 1, 2024
2. Add payment records for both pre and post July 2024 periods
3. Navigate to "ü§ù Negotiation Summary" page
4. Verify legal rule labels are correct for each period
5. Check that calculations use appropriate rules

### Scenario 2: Neutral Negotiation Phrasing
**Given**: A generated negotiation summary  
**When**: I review the phrasing  
**Then**: All terms related to market position must be neutral (e.g., "Aligned with market average")

**Test Steps**:
1. Generate a negotiation summary
2. Review all text in the summary
3. Verify no emotionally charged terms are used
4. Check that neutral alternatives are used consistently

### Scenario 3: Negotiation Mode - Calm
**Given**: The application is running  
**When**: I select "Calm" negotiation mode  
**Then**: The visualizations must hide growth arrows and use toned-down visuals

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to any page with charts
2. Select "Calm" mode from negotiation mode selector
3. Verify charts have subdued styling
4. Check that growth arrows are hidden
5. Confirm colors are muted/toned down

### Scenario 4: Negotiation Mode - Assertive
**Given**: The application is running  
**When**: I select "Assertive" negotiation mode  
**Then**: The visualizations must highlight changes and use bold numbers

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to any page with charts
2. Select "Assertive" mode from negotiation mode selector
3. Verify charts have bold styling
4. Check that changes are highlighted
5. Confirm numbers are displayed prominently

### Scenario 5: Agreement Period Annotations
**Given**: A TL vs USD chart is displayed  
**When**: Multiple rental agreements exist  
**Then**: Vertical markers labeled "New Agreement (YYYY)" must appear at the start date of each new agreement

**Test Steps**:
1. Create multiple rental agreements with different start dates
2. Add payment records for each agreement
3. Navigate to "üìà Visualizations" page
4. View the TL vs USD chart
5. Verify vertical markers appear at agreement start dates
6. Check that markers are labeled correctly

### Scenario 6: Data Source Disclosure
**Given**: Any exported summary  
**When**: I review the document  
**Then**: It must include the line "Data source: TCMB (exchange rates), T√úFE (inflation)"

**Test Steps**:
1. Generate any export (PDF, CSV, or text summary)
2. Open the exported document
3. Search for "Data source: TCMB (exchange rates), T√úFE (inflation)"
4. Verify the line appears in all exports

### Scenario 7: T√úFE Data Handling
**Given**: A period after July 1, 2024  
**When**: T√úFE data is unavailable  
**Then**: The system must display "T√úFE data pending" and allow manual entry

**Test Steps**:
1. Create rental agreement with start date after July 1, 2024
2. Ensure T√úFE data is not available for the period
3. Navigate to negotiation summary
4. Verify "T√úFE data pending" is displayed
5. Check that manual entry option is available
6. Test manual entry functionality

### Scenario 8: Negotiation Mode Persistence
**Given**: I have selected a negotiation mode  
**When**: I navigate between pages or refresh the application  
**Then**: My negotiation mode preference must persist

**Test Steps**:
1. Select "Assertive" negotiation mode
2. Navigate to different pages
3. Verify mode remains "Assertive"
4. Refresh the application
5. Check that mode is still "Assertive"
