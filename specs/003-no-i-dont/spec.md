# Feature Specification: No New Feature Branch Until Release

**Feature Branch**: `003-no-i-dont`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "no i dont need new feature branch until release"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager, I want to defer creating new feature branches until the release phase so that I can maintain a simpler development workflow and avoid premature feature branching.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am in the development phase, **When** I consider adding new features, **Then** I should not create new feature branches until release
2. **Given** I have existing feature branches, **When** I need to add functionality, **Then** I should work directly on the main branch or existing feature branches
3. **Given** I reach the release phase, **When** I need to add new features, **Then** I can create new feature branches as needed

### Edge Cases
- What happens if urgent features are needed during development?
- How does this affect the existing feature branch workflow?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-027**: System MUST defer creation of new feature branches until release phase
- **FR-028**: Development work MUST continue on existing branches or main branch during development phase
- **FR-029**: New feature branches MUST only be created when explicitly needed for release preparation
- **FR-030**: Existing feature branches MUST be maintained and used for ongoing development work
