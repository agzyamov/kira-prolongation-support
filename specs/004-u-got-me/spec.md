# Feature Specification: Remove Branches 2 and 3, Proceed with Branch 001

**Feature Branch**: `004-u-got-me`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "u got me wrong. get rid of branches 2 and 3. i wanna go ahead with 001 as of now"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager, I want to remove unnecessary feature branches (2 and 3) and focus on proceeding with the original feature branch (001) so that I can maintain a clean development workflow and avoid confusion.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have multiple feature branches (001, 002, 003), **When** I decide to clean up the project, **Then** I should remove branches 002 and 003
2. **Given** I have removed branches 002 and 003, **When** I continue development, **Then** I should proceed with branch 001
3. **Given** I am working on branch 001, **When** I need to add new features, **Then** I should continue development on this branch rather than creating new ones

### Edge Cases
- What happens if branch 001 has conflicts with the removed branches?
- How does this affect any work that was already done on branches 002 and 003?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-031**: System MUST remove feature branches 002 and 003 from the project
- **FR-032**: System MUST preserve and continue development on feature branch 001
- **FR-033**: Development work MUST proceed on branch 001 as the primary development branch
- **FR-034**: System MUST clean up any references to removed branches 002 and 003
- **FR-035**: System MUST ensure branch 001 remains functional and accessible after cleanup
