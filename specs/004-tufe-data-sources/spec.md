# Feature Specification: Research and Implement Secure TÜFE Data Sources

**Feature Branch**: `004-tufe-data-sources`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "wowow - dont scrap data - it might not be secure. find out where u can get tufe data from open sources"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the Rental Fee Negotiation Support Tool, I want the system to fetch TÜFE (Turkish Consumer Price Index) data from secure, official open data sources, so I can have accurate legal rent increase calculations without security risks.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the system needs TÜFE data for legal rent calculations, **When** I request TÜFE data, **Then** the system must fetch data from official, secure open data sources (not web scraping).
2. **Given** TÜFE data is requested, **When** the official data source is unavailable, **Then** the system must gracefully fall back to manual entry with clear user notification.
3. **Given** TÜFE data is fetched, **When** I view the data source information, **Then** it must clearly indicate the official source and fetch method used.
4. **Given** the system fetches TÜFE data, **When** the data is retrieved, **Then** it must be validated and stored securely in the local database.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if multiple official data sources are available? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we prioritize one source or allow user selection?]
- How should the system handle data format changes from official sources? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we implement versioning or just error handling?]
- What is the acceptable latency for TÜFE data fetching? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we cache data and for how long?]

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST identify and document official open data sources for TÜFE data.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST implement secure data fetching from official APIs or data portals.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST NOT use web scraping for TÜFE data retrieval.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST validate fetched TÜFE data before storing it.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide clear data source attribution in all exports and summaries.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST handle API failures gracefully with fallback to manual entry.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST cache TÜFE data locally to reduce API calls.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST allow users to manually override fetched data if needed.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: TÜFE data fetching MUST be secure and use HTTPS connections only.
- **NFR-002**: Data fetching MUST complete within 10 seconds or timeout gracefully.
- **NFR-003**: The system MUST handle rate limiting from official data sources.
- **NFR-004**: All data sources MUST be documented and verifiable.

## Key Entities

### TufeDataSource
- **source_name**: Official name of the data source
- **api_endpoint**: Secure API endpoint URL
- **data_format**: Expected data format (JSON, XML, CSV)
- **authentication**: Required authentication method
- **rate_limit**: API rate limiting information
- **last_updated**: When the source was last verified

### TufeDataCache
- **year**: Year of the TÜFE data
- **value**: TÜFE percentage value
- **source**: Source of the data
- **fetched_at**: When the data was fetched
- **expires_at**: When the cached data expires

## Clarifications

### Session 1: Data Source Research
**Date**: 2025-10-05  
**Context**: Initial research phase to identify secure open data sources

**Clarifications Made**:
1. **Primary Data Sources**: Research official Turkish government and international organizations that provide TÜFE data via APIs
2. **Security Requirements**: All data fetching must use official APIs with HTTPS, no web scraping
3. **Fallback Strategy**: If official APIs are unavailable, system should allow manual entry with clear warnings
4. **Data Validation**: All fetched data must be validated against expected ranges and formats
5. **Caching Strategy**: Implement local caching to reduce API calls and improve performance

**Outstanding Questions**:
- Which official data source should be prioritized if multiple are available?
- What is the acceptable cache duration for TÜFE data?
- Should the system support multiple data sources simultaneously?
