# Feature Specification: Add New Functional Requirements for Rental Fee Negotiation Support Tool

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-new-functional`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add new functional requirements for the "Rental Fee Negotiation Support Tool":"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a tenant preparing for rent negotiations, I want the system to provide legally compliant and professionally presented negotiation materials so that I can confidently discuss rent increases with my landlord using official data and neutral language.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have rental agreements spanning different legal periods, **When** I generate a negotiation summary, **Then** the system displays the correct legal cap (+25% for pre-July 2024, T√úFE for post-July 2024) with clear labeling
2. **Given** I want to present my case professionally, **When** I select "Calm" negotiation mode, **Then** the system removes growth arrows and uses subdued visuals
3. **Given** I want to emphasize changes strongly, **When** I select "Assertive" negotiation mode, **Then** the system highlights changes with bold numbers and prominent visual indicators
4. **Given** I view the rental payment chart, **When** I look at the timeline, **Then** I see vertical markers labeled "New Agreement (YYYY)" showing contract boundaries
5. **Given** I export a negotiation summary, **When** I review the document, **Then** it includes "Data source: TCMB (exchange rates), T√úFE (inflation)" for transparency

### Edge Cases
- What happens when T√úFE data is unavailable for a specific period?
- How does the system handle agreements that span the July 1, 2024 legal boundary?
- What if a user switches negotiation modes mid-session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-017**: System MUST automatically determine the applicable legal rule for rent increases based on agreement period (pre-July 2024: +25% cap, post-July 2024: T√úFE)
- **FR-018**: System MUST display legal maximum increase with clear labels ("+25% (limit until July 2024)" or "+CPI (Yearly T√úFE)")
- **FR-019**: System MUST use neutral negotiation phrasing ("Aligned with market average") instead of emotionally charged terms ("Above average")
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide user-selectable negotiation modes (Calm and Assertive)
- **FR-021**: System MUST hide growth arrows and tone down visuals in Calm mode
- **FR-022**: System MUST highlight changes and use bold numbers in Assertive mode
- **FR-023**: System MUST include vertical markers labeled "New Agreement (YYYY)" on the TL vs USD chart to show contract boundaries
- **FR-024**: System MUST include "Data source: TCMB (exchange rates), T√úFE (inflation)" in every exported summary
- **FR-025**: System MUST fetch official T√úFE (CPI) values from TCMB for periods after July 1, 2024
- **FR-026**: System MUST handle agreements that span the July 1, 2024 legal boundary by applying the appropriate rule for each period segment

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Legal Rule**: Represents the applicable rent increase regulation (fixed cap vs T√úFE) with effective date range and calculation method
- **Negotiation Mode**: User preference setting that controls visual presentation style (Calm/Assertive) and language tone
- **Agreement Period**: Time segment of a rental agreement that determines which legal rule applies
- **T√úFE Data**: Official inflation data from TCMB with date, value, and source attribution
